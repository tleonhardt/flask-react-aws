# Deploying a Flask and React Microservice to AWS ECS

This is my code from following along with the course 
[Deploying a Flask and React Microservice to AWS ECS](https://testdriven.io/courses/aws-flask-react).

It uses GitHub and AWS CodeBuild to create a CI/CD pipeline for deploying to AWS ECS/Fargate.
